= Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8 Installation Methods

You can install JBoss EAP 8.0 by using one of the following installation methods:

* *Using the zip or archive file*
* *Using the RPM installation method*
* *Using the JAR installer*

Let us see each of these methods in detail.

== Installing JBoss EAP using the Zip file or archive file

* In this method, the JBoss EAP 8 is distributed as a zip or archive file that you can extract and execute on an operating system (OS) with  OpenJDK 17 installed.
* These file contain all the libraries, configuration files, and scripts needed to start JBoss EAP, *without* further customization.
* This method is preferred when:
** You don't have GUI support for the EAP 8 installation.
** You don't want to have any custom configuration.
** You need text based console for the EAP 8 installation.
* Due to its portable nature, you can use it on multiple platforms(like Windows, Linux, etc.) and it requires OpenJDK 17 installed on the host OS.

== Installing JBoss EAP by using the RPM installation method

* JBoss EAP 8 is available as an RPM package for users with a valid subscription to the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform sub-channel, in the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform group.
* The yum command downloads all the RPMs to the host OS, and automatically installs all the files needed to start and manage JBoss EAP.
* The RPM installation method is only valid for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system and not for Windows server.
* This method is preferred when you want JBoss EAP service files to be installed for the RHEL operating system.

== Installing JBoss EAP using the JAR installer

* This provides an "interactive" graphical approach where you can customize the JBoss EAP installation process.
* In this method, the jar file is a Java based application that is responsible for providing a step-by-step way to customize the environment setup.
* This method is preferred when:
** You want to install on *multiple platforms* like Windows server, Linux etc.
** You need either graphical interface or a text based console.
** You want to customise JBoss EAP installation.
* Due to its flexible nature, the installer can install JBoss EAP by using a response file, with all the options passed as an XML file.

== Pre-requisites

* You have installed https://access.redhat.com/articles/6961381[Red Hat supported OpenJDK 17] on RHEL 9 server.
* Recommended to create a separate *jboss* user account with no shell access (/sbin/nologin).
* Recommended to download all installation file under /opt partition.
* Recommended to ensure that there is enough space under /opt partition (minimum 800MB).

== (Optional) Pre-configured RHEL9 settings using Vagrant

* You can install https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/installation[vagrant] on your host machine.

* You can refer https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/eap-qc-apps[EAP8 vagrant settings] repository using *Vagrantfile* present at "admin1/eap8-vagrant/" to configure the RHEL 9 server for JBoss to get started.

== Lab 1: Installing JBoss EAP using the Zip file

*Outcome*: In this lab, you download `jboss-eap-8.0.0-installation-manager.zip` file and install JBoss EAP as a standalone server that can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080`.

* Take GUI access of RHEL 9 server.

* Download the zip or archive file by following below steps:
** Open a firefox browser.
** Log in to the https://access.redhat.com/[Red Hat Customer Portal].
** Click Downloads.
** Select `Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform` from the `Product Downloads` list.
** In the Version drop-down list, select `8.0`.
** Find `Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8.0 Installation Manager` in the list if you want to download zip file or find `Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 8.0.0` in the list if you want to download archive file and click the `Download` link. This lab assumes that you have downloaded the zip file.
** The file would get downloaded under your `~/Downloads` directory.

* Open a terminal instance and copy `jboss-eap-8.0.0-installation-manager.zip` file present under `~/Downloads` directory to `/opt` directory as a sudo user.

== Lab 4: Uninstalling JBoss EAP

=== Uninstalling JBoss EAP (ZIP Installation)

* Ensure that you back up any modified configuration files and deployments that may be reused.

* The zip installation method installs JBoss EAP in a single directory. Delete the installation directory to uninstall JBoss EAP.

* Also delete any other scripts that are dependent on JBoss EAP being installed on your machine.

=== Uninstalling JBoss EAP (GUI Installer Installation)

* Open a terminal and navigate to EAP_HOME/uninstaller.

* Run the graphical uninstaller using the following command:
+
[subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
[vagrant@server ~]$ java -jar uninstaller.jar
----

* The graphical uninstaller is similar to following figure. Click Uninstall to start the uninstall process.
+
image::uninstall.png[align="center"]

* When the uninstall process is finished, click Quit to exit the uninstaller.

=== Removing JBoss EAP RHEL service

* Delete the JBoss EAP8 configuration file
* Stop and disable the jboss-eap service.
+
[subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
[vagrant@server ~]$ sudo systemctl stop jboss-eap
[vagrant@server ~]$ sudo systemctl disable jboss-eap
----

* Delete the JBoss EAP8 configuration file `/etc/default/jboss-eap.conf`.

* Delete the JBoss EAP8 script `/etc/init.d/jboss-eap`.

=== Uninstalling JBoss EAP (RPM Installation)

* Remove the `jboss-eap8` package.
+
[subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
[vagrant@server ~]$  sudo dnf groupremove jboss-eap8 -y
----

* Because of the nature of RPM package management, it cannot be guaranteed that all installed packages and dependencies will be completely removed. Hence remove other related files manually.
