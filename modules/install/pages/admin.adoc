= Managing JBoss EAP

== JBoss EAP 8 Management Options

* JBoss EAP 8 has multiple subsystems that you can customize to support Jakarta EE application requirements, such as database connectivity, batch processing, and integration tools.

* The subsystem configuration is maintained in the `standalone.xml` file for the standalone mode, and the `domain.xml` file for a managed domain mode.

* These configuration files can be customized using three different approaches:

** **Management console**: As a system administrator, you can manage most of the capabilities of your standalone or managed domain deployments by using a browser.

** **Management Command Line Interface(CLI)**:
The CLI offers a management model for viewing and modifying attributes and for performing operations, on a standalone server or a managed domain.

** **Edit XML configuration files manually**:
The settings of a standalone server or a managed domain are maintained in XML-based configuration files, which can be modified directly.

== Creating Administrative Users

* The JBoss EAP installer creates an administrative user during the installation process.

* If additional administrative users are required, or if the installation was NOT done using the JBoss EAP installer, then you can create new users.

=== Types of users

* You can add two different types of users:
** **Management user**: They are responsible for accessing the administrative tools from JBoss EAP.
** **Application user**: They are used by Jakarta EE applications.

* You can create these users by using the `add-user.sh` script in interactive as well as non-interactive mode.
