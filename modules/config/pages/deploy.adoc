= Deploying Applications to a Standalone Server

== The Deployments Section of the standalone.xml file

* You can deploy Jakarta EE applications to a standalone JBoss EAP 8 instance by configuring the <deployments> section in the `standalone.xml` file.

* Each `<deployment>` element within `<deployments>` corresponds to an application.

* For example:
+
[subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
<deployments>
  <deployment name="kitchensink.war" runtime-name="kitchensink.war">
      <content sha1="f9418ea27525e0f3c02ea099405265246b22b55a"/>
  </deployment>
  <deployment name="temperature-converter.war" runtime-name="temperature-converter.war">
      <content sha1="555df23b973ed9f76f7c817deec3bab6a13a7ea3"/>
  </deployment>
  <deployment name="numberguess.war" runtime-name="numberguess.war">
      <fs-exploded path="/opt/apps/numberguess.war"/>
  </deployment>
</deployments>
----

* The example above deploys three applications:
. kitchensink.war: Managed by JBoss EAP
. temperature-converter.war: Managed by JBoss EAP
. numberguess.war: Deployed by using the unmanaged method

* The <content> element contains a unique secure hash algorithm (SHA) value, serving as the deployment's identifier.

* The managed deployments are stored in the `$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/data/content` directory which is the deployment cache directory.

* JBoss EAP 8 organizes files by creating a directory named after the first two characters of the SHA1 code. Within this directory, another subdirectory is made with the remaining characters of the code.

* For the deployments listed above, the following directory should be available:
+
[subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
[vagrant@server labs]$ tree -d JBOSS_HOME/standalone/data/content/
standalone/data/content/
├── 55
│   └── 5df23b973ed9f76f7c817deec3bab6a13a7ea3
└── f9
    └── 418ea27525e0f3c02ea099405265246b22b55a
----

* The `numberguess.war` application is deployed by using the unmanaged approach. Therefore, its files are not present in the `$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/data/content` directory.

[NOTE]
====
Note: Red Hat does not recommend adding a <deployment> element to the <deployments> section of a JBoss EAP configuration manually. However, it is possible to delete entries manually, and restart the server to undeploy an application.
====

== Deploying Applications with Management Tools

* The deployment process in JBoss EAP 8 involves installing an application by copying the package and executing necessary server configurations.

* There are three ways to deploy an application to a standalone server:
. The management console
. The management CLI
. The file system deployer

=== Deploying through the Management Console.

* The management console has a section to manage the deployments available in the standalone server.

* This section is available in the management console, in the `Deployments` menu at the top of the page.
+
image::new8.png[align="center"]

* You can create a deployment by clicking Add, to start the deployments wizard.
+
image::new9.png[align="center"]

* The first step of the wizard asks for the type of the deployment. Three options are available:

. **Upload Deployment**
.. By using this option, you upload an application.
.. This upload makes the application available in the `$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/data/content` directory, and adds a <deployment> element in the `standalone.xml` configuration file.

. **Add Unmanaged Deployment**
.. This option requires specifying a path to the application archive.
.. It called unmanaged because JBoss EAP 8 doesn't store the application in the deployment cache, allowing any user with permission to the configuration file to remove it.

. **Create Empty Deployment**
. This option creates an empty deployment in an directory with the same structure of an enterprise application archive (EAR), or a web application archive (WAR).
.. You can test deployments by copying individual files to that directory.

* You can upload the application file by using the Upload Deployment option. You can select a file from your local file system, or drag and drop the application file.
+
image::new3.png[align="center"]

* The next step on the wizard has three options to be defined:
+
image::new4.png[align="center"]

. **Name**:
.. Identifies the deployment.
.. It must be a unique value across all deployments.

. **Runtime Name**
.. Identifies the deployment internally within the server runtime.
.. JBoss EAP bases internal names for application modules, such as EJB names, in this runtime name.
.. It is common that the value for Name, and Runtime Name are the same.

. **Enabled**
.. Defines if the deployment should start immediately.
.. If it is not checked, then it is possible to enable it later.

== Enabling and Disabling a Deployment by Using the Management Console

* An application can be configured to start during the startup of JBoss EAP.

* Configure the deployment as enabled if it should start during JBoss EAP startup.

* You can enable and disable a deployment in the management console by using the `Deployments` menu.

* To disable an application, click the application. A combo box shows. Clicking the down arrow, the Disable option is displayed. Click Disable and then, in the confirmation screen, click Confirm to disable the deployment.
+
image::new6.png[align="center"]

* To enable a deployment, click the application and the combo box shows again. Click the down arrow to see the Enable option. Click Enable and then, in the confirmation screen, click Confirm to enable the deployment.
+
image::new10.png[align="center"]

== Undeploying an Application Using the Management Console

* You can undeploy applications in the management console by using the `Deployments` menu.

* To undeploy an application, click the application. A combo box shows.
+
image::new11.png[align="center"]

* Click the down arrow, to see the Remove option. Click Remove and then, in the confirmation screen, click Confirm to undeploy the application.
+
image::new12.png[align="center"]

[NOTE]
====
Note: Undeploying is different from disabling a deployment. Undeploying removes the application from JBoss EAP, uninstalling it entirely. Disabling prevents the server from starting the application, but it can be re-enabled later.
====

== Deploying Using the Management CLI

* The management CLI provides the deploy command to start a deployment.

* The following is a list of arguments for the deploy command:

. **file_path**
.. Path to the application to deploy.

. **--url**
.. URL at which the deployment content is available for upload to the deployment content repository.

. **--name**
.. The unique name of the deployment. If no name is provided, then the file name is used.

. **--runtime-name**
.. Optional, defines the runtime name for the deployment.

. **--force**
.. If the deployment with the specified name already exists, by default, then the deployment is aborted and the corresponding message is printed.
.. The --force, or -f argument forces the replacement of the existing deployment with the one specified in the command arguments.

. **--disabled**
.. Indicates that the deployment is added to the repository, but in a disabled state.

* To deploy an application that is located at `/home/vagrant/myapp.war` use the following command:
+
[subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
[standalone@localhost:19990 /] deploy /home/vagrant/myapp.war --name=myapp.war
----

== Undeploying Using the Management CLI Tool

* The management CLI provides the undeploy command to remove a deployment.

* The following is a list of arguments for the undeploy command:

. **name**
.. The name of the application to undeploy.

. **--keep-content**
.. Disable the deployment but do not remove its content from the repository.
+
[subs="+quotes,+macros"]
----
[standalone@localhost:19990 /] undeploy myapp.war

== Lab 1: Deploy application using the management console

**Outcome**: You should be able to deploy the application on JBoss EAP 8 standalone server using management console.

* Open a terminal window from the workstation machine, and run the following commands to start the JBoss EAP 8 server using the /home/student/AD248/labs/deploying-standalone/standalone-instance as the base directory:
+
